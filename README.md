CI/CD Pipeline R&amp;D - Simple Express app code-base using GitHub Actions to support a Hackathon team. 

Ideally, this will lead to SOPs, playbook, tutorials, etc. where a Hackathon team can quickly validate, build and deploy an app using a repeatable process to achieve consistency while retaining and increasing quality.
